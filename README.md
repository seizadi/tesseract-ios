tesseract-ios
=============

About
-----

Tesseract-ios is an IOS Library Tesseract OCR(http://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/).
I wrote this since I could not find a recent Tesseract 3.02.02 distribution, so I had build it from source. There were various directions and source scattered on the web, I decided to put it all under source control and test is on the latest IOS SDK/OS.


This project is based on following:
 - [Ã‚ngelo Suzuki's blog post](http://tinsuke.wordpress.com/2011/11/01/how-to-compile-and-use-tesseract-3-01-on-ios-sdk-5/)
